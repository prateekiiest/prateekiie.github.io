## Objective
I love working in fast-paced, Unix-based development / server administration roles (devops) as part of a highly collaborative and innovative team. Keeping up with the latest technologies is a very high priority. Furthering and broadening my knowledge of the Linux operating system and the various programming languages that make it useful.

## Capabilities
* Proficient in UNIX-like environments, including Red Hat Enterprise and variants, Debian and variants, and FreeBSD.
* I am a Red Hat Certified Technician / Engineer and plan on furthering my certification with Red Hat.
* Proficient in Bash/Shell, Python, ANSI C, and PHP for both web-based front-ends as well as server-side automation.
* Understanding of object-oriented programming models and MVC.
* Knowledgeable in standard networking protocols and tools (SMB, SMTP, IMAP, SSH, NFS, IPTables, etc...)
* Familiarity with Windows Server 2003 / 2008 Standard, Enterprise, and Datacenter edition, and basic services such as RDC, Terminal Server, and MSSQL. Some experience with Hyper-V.
* Strong knowledge with the Linux kernel, customizing Linux kernels, and the Linux boot process.
* Familiarity with Cisco PIX hardware firewalls, mainly the 501 model.
* Strong background in server management, including distributed management of many like computers.
* In-depth understanding of newer technologies such as Puppet. Skilled in formulating Puppet manifests, including classes, file / exec / cron / package / service resources etc. I pay close attention to patterns and make heavy use of relationships (run stages, inheritance, dependencies)
* Strong packaging skills in RPM format. Experience building and maintaining multiple versions of packages while keeping dependency resolution consistent.
* Experience in back-porting software in the Linux kernel, Apache HTTP server, bash shell, and other programs to bring newer, needed features into an enterprise distribution without deviating otherwise from the original patched sources.
* I have an innovative mind and am capable of inventing ways around problems and road blocks.
* Experience using VMWare, utilizing OVF properties to automate deployment, and working with the VMWare Linux tools suite.
* Experience in working with different open source licenses within a large corporation

## Relevant Experience
### Machine Intelligence Unit, Indian Statistical Institute (May 2018 - Aug 2018)
* Implemented a k-means centric optimization approach to discover similarity
metrics from data distribution with better convergence and a 6.5% increase in
accuracy measured by silhouette score compared to traditional methods.
* Performed comparative theoretical analysis on traditional metric learning
algorithms with respect to precision metrics and convergence speed.

### Linux Foundation - OpenDaylight (Jul 2018 - Nov 2018)
* Designed an automated Jenkins support for building jobs in Maven through a
bot service affecting over 75% of Opendaylight projects. Commits
* Implemented a version of mediawiki-rst migration for conversion of mediawiki
proposals to otherformats. Worked on an automated design for constructing
project dependency graph for over 93% versions of OpenDaylight projects.

### FOSSASIA - SUSI.AI (Jun 2018 - Sept 2018)
* Worked in a team of 126 developers to develop prototype forthe SUSI Smart
Speaker Application along with implementation of APIs for various SUSI skills.
* Implemented speech-to-text and text-to-speech functionality forthe Smart
Speaker system with improved voice recognition accuracy of 91% measured
using standard measures like Word errorrate.

### Complex Network Research Group, IIT Kharagpur (May 2017 - Jun 2017)
* Designed classification models upon student group dataset to predict group
formation and group dynamics using mobile sensor data like wifi location,
accelerometer values and voice levels.
* Achieved average precision of 88.9% measured by standard accuracy measures
as compared to other proposed models.

### SunPy, OpenAstronomy (Dec 2016 - Apr 2018)
* Collaborated with a team of 60 researchers from NASA GSFC, UCL and
Stanford on development of solarimage processing algorithms and solar data
storage functionality enhancements.
* Worked on implementation of solarimage processing algorithms - Multi-scale
Gaussian Normalisation with 18% improved memory utilization and better
feature extraction with less noise.
* Got acknowledged along with researchers at NASA Goddard Space Flight
Centerin nine releases for contributions to the project.
