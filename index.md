## Objective
I love working in fast-paced, Unix-based development / server administration roles (devops) as part of a highly collaborative and innovative team. Keeping up with the latest technologies is a very high priority. Furthering and broadening my knowledge of the Linux operating system and the various programming languages that make it useful.

## Capabilities
* Proficient in UNIX-like environments, including Red Hat Enterprise and variants, Debian and variants, and FreeBSD.
* I am a Red Hat Certified Technician / Engineer and plan on furthering my certification with Red Hat.
* Proficient in Bash/Shell, Python, ANSI C, and PHP for both web-based front-ends as well as server-side automation.
* Understanding of object-oriented programming models and MVC.
* Knowledgeable in standard networking protocols and tools (SMB, SMTP, IMAP, SSH, NFS, IPTables, etc...)
* Familiarity with Windows Server 2003 / 2008 Standard, Enterprise, and Datacenter edition, and basic services such as RDC, Terminal Server, and MSSQL. Some experience with Hyper-V.
* Strong knowledge with the Linux kernel, customizing Linux kernels, and the Linux boot process.
* Familiarity with Cisco PIX hardware firewalls, mainly the 501 model.
* Strong background in server management, including distributed management of many like computers.
* In-depth understanding of newer technologies such as Puppet. Skilled in formulating Puppet manifests, including classes, file / exec / cron / package / service resources etc. I pay close attention to patterns and make heavy use of relationships (run stages, inheritance, dependencies)
* Strong packaging skills in RPM format. Experience building and maintaining multiple versions of packages while keeping dependency resolution consistent.
* Experience in back-porting software in the Linux kernel, Apache HTTP server, bash shell, and other programs to bring newer, needed features into an enterprise distribution without deviating otherwise from the original patched sources.
* I have an innovative mind and am capable of inventing ways around problems and road blocks.
* Experience using VMWare, utilizing OVF properties to automate deployment, and working with the VMWare Linux tools suite.
* Experience in working with different open source licenses within a large corporation

## Relevant Experience
### Machine Intelligence Unit, Indian Statistical Institute (May 2018 - Aug 2018)
* Implemented a k-means centric optimization approach to discover similarity
metrics from data distribution with better convergence and a 6.5% increase in
accuracy measured by silhouette score compared to traditional methods.
* Performed comparative theoretical analysis on traditional metric learning
algorithms with respect to precision metrics and convergence speed.

### Complex Network Research Group, IIT Kharagpur (May 2017 - Jun 2017)
* Designed classification models upon student group dataset to predict group
formation and group dynamics using mobile sensor data like wifi location,
accelerometer values and voice levels.
* Achieved average precision of 88.9% measured by standard accuracy measures
as compared to other proposed models.


### California Reigonal Intranet / Complex Drive Business Internet (2005 - 2006)
* Began as a sales representative in early 2005
* Transferred to Support department a few months after hire
* Worked mainly with server configurations, as well as providing support to network engineers and sysadmins.
* Attended weekly training seminars in the Complex Drive colocation facility, covering shell scripting, mail troubleshooting, and other various administration essentials.

## Specialized Training
* RedHat Certified Technician # 605007617314710 (verify at <https://www.redhat.com/training/certification/verify>)
* RedHat Certified Engineer # 805008830334209 (verify at <https://www.redhat.com/training/certification/verify>)
* RedHat Certified System Administrator # 100-018-837 (verify at <https://www.redhat.com/training/certification/verify>)
* Parallels Automation Professional for Parallels Plesk Panel for Linux
* Parallels Automation Engineer for Parallels Plesk Panel for Linux
* Parallels Certified Virtualization Professional for Linux

## Other Qualifications
* Implemented automated unit testing and static analysis using PHPUnit and home-grown software testing tools.
* Familiar with Nagios and other monitoring platforms, and have scripted many daily duties as the administrator of such servers.
* Performed kernel-level patching and packaging in RPM format
* Familiar with remote logging mechanisms (primarily rsyslogd) and the monitorware database schema, as well as configuration and maintenance of GUI interfaces such as Adicson Log Analyzer and Splunk.
* Re-wrote many scripts used on a daily basis for a growing dedicated server business, including automated customer notification emails, simple fixes for common dedicated server problems, and automations for tedious everyday tasks.
* Wrote a Linux debugging script that repaired root-compromised servers. Parts of the script were deployed across a network and serviced many dedicated servers.
* Managed a small group of desktop computers with both Linux and Microsoft operating systems, including tasks such as normal security updates, filesystem maintenance, user management, remote home directories / NIS authentication, and application installation / configuration.
* Ran a dedicated server for many years, successfully migrated it with no data loss and minimal service interruption.
* Understandiong of the importance of monitoring server logs and resource utilization.
* Wrote server provisioning software capable of booting a computer via PXE and DHCP, partitioning hard drives, and deploying an operating system. The program is completely manageable through a self-written and easy-to-use web interface. It is capable of being implemented on large networks, and utilizes modern technologies including NFS, Apache, PHP, Bash, Linux, and SQLite among many others.
* Completed a number of side-jobs, mainly in web development, using utilities such as Flash, HTML, and CSS. Many of these projects included a dynamic back-end for the user to update their website on their own.
* Experience administrating devices controlled by Cisco IOS software.
* Kept regular backups of multiple hosts for a number of years. All backups were stored with multiple increments.
