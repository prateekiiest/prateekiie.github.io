## Objective
I love working in fast-paced, Unix-based development / server administration roles (devops) as part of a highly collaborative and innovative team. Keeping up with the latest technologies is a very high priority. Furthering and broadening my knowledge of the Linux operating system and the various programming languages that make it useful.

## Relevant Experience
### Machine Intelligence Unit, Indian Statistical Institute (May 2018 - Aug 2018)
* Implemented a k-means centric optimization approach to discover similarity
metrics from data distribution with better convergence and a 6.5% increase in
accuracy measured by silhouette score compared to traditional methods.
* Performed comparative theoretical analysis on traditional metric learning
algorithms with respect to precision metrics and convergence speed.

### Linux Foundation - OpenDaylight (Jul 2018 - Nov 2018)
* Designed an automated Jenkins support for building jobs in Maven through a
bot service affecting over 75% of Opendaylight projects. Commits
* Implemented a version of mediawiki-rst migration for conversion of mediawiki
proposals to otherformats. Worked on an automated design for constructing
project dependency graph for over 93% versions of OpenDaylight projects.

### FOSSASIA - SUSI.AI (Jun 2018 - Sept 2018)
* Worked in a team of 126 developers to develop prototype forthe SUSI Smart
Speaker Application along with implementation of APIs for various SUSI skills.
* Implemented speech-to-text and text-to-speech functionality forthe Smart
Speaker system with improved voice recognition accuracy of 91% measured
using standard measures like Word errorrate.

### Complex Network Research Group, IIT Kharagpur (May 2017 - Jun 2017)
* Designed classification models upon student group dataset to predict group
formation and group dynamics using mobile sensor data like wifi location,
accelerometer values and voice levels.
* Achieved average precision of 88.9% measured by standard accuracy measures
as compared to other proposed models.

### SunPy, OpenAstronomy (Dec 2016 - Apr 2018)
* Collaborated with a team of 60 researchers from NASA GSFC, UCL and
Stanford on development of solarimage processing algorithms and solar data
storage functionality enhancements.
* Worked on implementation of solarimage processing algorithms - Multi-scale
Gaussian Normalisation with 18% improved memory utilization and better
feature extraction with less noise.
* Got acknowledged along with researchers at NASA Goddard Space Flight
Centerin nine releases for contributions to the project.
