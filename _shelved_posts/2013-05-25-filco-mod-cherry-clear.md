I decided after a few weeks of use that I actually don't like clicky switches on
my keyboard. At all. They sound cool for a little while but after typing
seriously on them for a while, I tire of the clicky noise and just wish they
would shut up.

At first I thought I would sell my Filco board with Cherry MX blue switches and
go back to browns. But instead, I ended up buying Cherry MX clear key switches
and modding the Filco with them. This involved quite a bit of disassembly. Not
only the case and key caps but also desoldering every single MX blue switch.
There are 87 keys on my keyboard and each has 2 pins, so this took a while, but
the results are worth it.

Here are a few pictures of the process. They aren't strictly in order. I won't
bother going into the gritty details because those can be found in many other
places online, including

After going through this process, I have one piece of advice: don't buy the
Radio Shack desoldering iron with the built-in pump attachment. The head on mine
crumbled half-way through (pictured above), thus turning it into a paper weight
until I get a new head. A normal soldering iron with a solder vaccuum worked far
better for me, and I wish I hadn't used the Radio Shack iron at all. Also, a
25-watt Weller soldering iron was more than enough power for this job. You do
not need an iron that goes past 750 degrees F to mod a Filco keyboard.
