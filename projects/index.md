Below are some original open source projects I have released. 

Many of the below software projects are available for installation using my
[software repositories](/software-repos)

### Code Sleep Python

This repository contains a curated list of some of the awesome small projects made in Python that you can code away this summer. It includes analysis of different Python modules, a deep analysis of the Python statistics modules and dataframes like Pandas. It has some projects on classification, correlation and regression which are the fundamental building blocks of Machine Learning and Neural Networks.

### Building Artificial Neural Networks

Implemented various artificial neural networks including SLP, MLP and RBF
from scratch and its applications on various data sets along with their detailed
theoretical analysis.

### veneer
veneer is an experimental framework for creating RESTful API's in PHP. It
features a simple router, built-in input validation and documentation
facilities, and integrates easily with other useful frameworks and protocols.

### veneer-swagger
veneer-swagger is an endpoint definition for the veneer framework that exposes
all defined endpoint documentation via a RESTful interface that can be directly
consumed by the swagger protocol from Wordnik. When coupled with swagger-ui
(also from Wordnik), you can have interactive API documentation almost for free.

### puppet-packagelist
puppet-packagelist is a puppet module which can be used to define all packages
to be installed on a given system. It offers a `purge` option, which can remove
any packages that are not defined in the list you pass in. Lists can be passed
in as simple text files or within puppet as an array.

### puppet-tell
puppet-tell is an experimental puppet module which can notify external parties
when resources are changed. As an example, you want to notify a web hook
whenever the Linux kernel is updated as part of your puppet run, puppet-tell can
do that for you. It supports web hooks and SMTP.

### Sertify
Sertify was a weekend project to create an easy way of defining input validation
functions one time in a short and descriptive YAML file, and then generating
code in many languages based on the YAML template. It can generate code for
Bash, PHP, Ruby, and Python.
