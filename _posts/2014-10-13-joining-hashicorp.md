Today is my first day working for [Hashicorp](http://hashicorp.com)!

I've been helping in various parts of open source Hashicorp software for a
little while now, just on my own time late at night or over weekends. Having the
opportunity to do what I love full time for an awesome company is an absolute
blessing.

Hashicorp makes DevOps tooling. We are the company behind software like
[Vagrant](http://vagrantup.com), [Packer](http://packer.io),
[Serf](http://serfdom.io), [Consul](http://consul.io), and
[Terraform](http://terraform.io).

I couldn't ask for a better team to work with. I haven't met everyone on our
6-person roster yet, but am excited to get started collaborating.

I hope to really find my stride here, and become much more involved in the
community and in the code itself. Check out Hashicorp and the projects we work
on if you haven't already at [hashicorp.com](http://hashicorp.com).
