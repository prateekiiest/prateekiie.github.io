Over some time dabbling in REST frameworks and writing various types of interfaces for
all sorts of different tasks, I decided to spend some time over a couple of weekends
and take a stab at a small framework built around my most general use cases. I think
it actually came out pretty nice, which is why I've decided to open source it. I've
named it the veneer framework for PHP, since I've mainly used it to put up REST
interfaces in front of some more complex tasks involving databases, web requests,
monitoring and more, effectively putting some veneer over the top of an otherwise
ugly and / or complex task.

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/ryanuber/veneer.png)](https://travis-ci.org/ryanuber/veneer)

### Create a file named "hello.php" with the following contents :
```php
<?php
namespace veneer\endpoint\hello;
class v1 extends \veneer\call
{
    public $get = array('/:name' => 'hello');
    public function hello($args)
    {
        return $this->response->set("Hello, {$args['name']}!", 200);
    }
}
?>
```

### And a file called "run.php" with these contents:
```php
<?php
require 'veneer/veneer.php';
require 'hello.php';
\veneer\app::listen();
?>
```

### Run this command :
```
$ php run.php
veneer\http\server : Validating PHP environment...
veneer\http\server : Found endpoint: v1/hello
veneer\http\server : Listening on 0.0.0.0:8080
```

### Then try out your new API :
```
$ curl http://localhost:8080/v1/hello/world
"Hello, world!"
```

FAQ

### How can I get the output in another format?
```
$ curl http://localhost:8080/v1/hello/world?format=json
$ curl -H 'format: json' http://localhost:8080/v1/hello/world
```
The default serialization type is json, but you can configure that by
calling `\veneer\app::set_default('output_handler', 'xyz')`, where `xyz`
is any other output handler. You can also change the parameter that
indicates the output handler by calling
`\veneer\app::set_default('output_handler_param', 'xyz')`, where `xyz`
is the parameter name. Other built-in handlers include `serialize`,
`plain`, and `html`. You can easily add to the available output handlers.
Take a look in `veneer/output/handler/*` for some examples.

### How can I use this under Apache, Nginx, Lighttpd, or web server x?
Rewrite all requests to your `run.php` file (or whatever you called it)

Apache
```
RewriteEngine On
RewriteRule ^(.*)$ run.php [QSA]
```

Nginx
```
rewrite ^ run.php?$args? ;
```

lighttpd
```
url.rewrite = (
  "^(.*)$" => "run.php$1"
)
```

run.php file
```php
<?php
require 'veneer/veneer.php';
require 'hello.php';
// Note this call to run(), not listen()
\veneer\app::run();
?>
```

### What about some more advanced features?
